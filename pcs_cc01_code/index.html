            I had missed the first class because I wasn’t sure if I could fit the course in with my schedule, but I made it work! I really like Al and Nìm’s complimentary teaching styles. My brain is liking the flow of the class. Having a short break regularly lets me refresh. I had a great time learning about my peers and seeing what’s to come in the course syllabus. 
          </p>

            I spent my week on Treehouse and CodeAcademy learning HTML, CSS, and Git. We also downloaded text editors, and a server. I didn’t realize how hungry coding would make me in three hours. I’ll have to remember to bring a nice salad and kombucha to class next week.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing that was difficult the first week was I learned my computer software was three years old. Later when I went home I spent about five hours updating everything! This meant five hours I could have been doing homework...yet, I was excited to have the newest software on my laptop. Stressful and exciting - that pretty much describes my first week experience.
          </p>

          <h3>Top Concepts for Week 1</h3>
          <ul class="list_one">
            <li>I heart Al and Nìm</li>
            <li>Short breaks are appreciated</li>
            <li>New technologies can be difficult to wrap your head around</li>
            <li>Learning to heart Treehouse</li>
            <li>Keeping up to date with the latest software and technology is crucial</li>
          </ul>

            It's my second week in the PCS Front-End Freelancer class and the experience so far has been great! Teachers Al and Nìm make a great duo with their coding and freelancing experience. I’ve been watching the treehouse videos, but I’m not sure if my brain is absorbing the information. The other students and the teachers are talking, but I’m not sure what language… My highlight of week two - Chrome Dev Tools! It's a great way to build and debug your web applications. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been quite busy looking for a Junior Developing position. Tracking-down people, researching companies, and working on projects can really take a lot of time and patience. Balancing this with Front End class and family is very tight. I appreciate Al and Nìm asking for class feedback on what’s working for us. It was useful to me to see how everyone is feeling and hearing points I hadn’t thought of. 
          </p>

          <h3>Top Concepts for Week 2</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I still heart Al and Nìm</li>
            <li>Learning how to work with clients and manage time are very important</li>
            <li>Use Chrome Dev Tools to edit HTML, CSS, &amp;JavaScript files in browser </li>
            <li>Coding is definitely a different language</li>
            <li>Learning more about our classmates and teachers is interesting</li>
          </ul>
